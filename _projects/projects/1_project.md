## Overview
Briefly introduce the problem and why it matters. Define the scope, target users, and expected impact.

## Approach
- Key idea 1 (e.g., ISAC waveform/beam co-design).
- Key idea 2 (e.g., AI-native RAN with xApps/rApps in the Near-RT RIC).
- Key idea 3 (e.g., privacy-preserving training / PLS integration).

## Results
- Metric A improved by **XX%** vs. baseline on real data.
- Real-world prototype on **POWDER** (or your testbed), stable over **N** trials.
- Include figures, tables, or links to datasets/videos.
